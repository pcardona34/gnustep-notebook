NoteBook.app is a note taking app created by Jeremy Cowgar.

## 
Though it is still mentionned on several places, like:
 <https://mediawiki.gnustep.org/index.php/NoteBook.app>, even in several BSD ports,
these **links are dead**.

I found an archive of the source using the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org).
